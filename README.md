# Car_Price_Purchase 



You are working as a car salesman and you would like to develop a model to predict the total dollar amount that customers are willing to pay given the following attributes:

                   1.Customer Name
                   2.Customer e-mail
                   3.Country
                   4.Gender
                   5.Age
                   6.Annual Salary
                   7.Credit Card Debt
                   8.Net Worth

The model should predict:

             1.Car Purchase Amount
Since it is an regression Problem statement we are using ANN for developing Genralised Model.
